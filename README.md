# STAT5702_NYC_Employment_Analysis

## Ideas for intro:

### Background: 

NYC might just be the city with the richest employment landscape in the world. From blue collar workers to big corporation executives, and strong representation from almost every ethnicity, New York has it all. In addition to this, it happens to be a city where the municipality as well as federal government sources provide detailed data about the employment landscape.These factors contribute to the New York as a good candidate for to conduct exploratory data analysis.

### Purpose: 

Explore employment and job data in NYC through the period 2010-2019. Potentially draw conclusions about the landscape with regards to employment, demographics, and salary. 

### Potential areas of interest:

Explore the employment of demographics (e.g: race, gender) and their fluctuations. Potential to find disparities in different demographics employment levels, explore reasons why this might be the case. Connect these disparities to this being a probabilistic tendency based on our intuition, current events at the time, or trends.

Explore the employment of people working in different fields. Explore trends in how likely certain sectors are to be employed and how this changes over time. See how this has reacted over our period to current events or trends.

Explore disparities by demographic of people working in different fields. Do people of different demographics prefer to work in certain fields? Does this correspond with our intuition on the matter.

Explore disparities in unemployment by demographic factors. See if there are demographic groups with a higher propensity for unemployment, explore the reasons as to why this might be the case.

Explore disparities in salary across demographics and also across different sectors. 

### Data Sources: 

In the Github repository of this project, there is a Word Document 'DataSource' which can be consulted for the links to the data source. The employment data comes directly from the city of new york website and census.gov. The economic + job growth data comes from the nyc.gov website, census.gov.
